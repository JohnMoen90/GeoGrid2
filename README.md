# GeoGrid2
GeoGrid2 displays world tiles with an OpenGL renderer

Currently this program does NOT have a way to select new long lat coordinates via a
gui or even from console commands, they must be changed manually in the Mesh class.

Only Coordinates that would fall in the continental US will work

Currently Color values only work at certain altitudes do to the strange scaling of the
.hgt files I have found the area in the rocky mountains around N45W115 to be the
best for the current scale.
